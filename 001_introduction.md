# Introduction

War crimes are difficult to define rigidly but easy to understand when you see one. Oftentimes in a warzone, many innocent people tragically die, but this does not mean all civilian casualties are labeled as “war crimes” because this would cause the term to be too vague, common, and subjective to have any clear meaning in discussion. In situations as complex and violent as war, the line drawn between standard warfare and crimes against humanity usually revolves around two factors: who is targeted and how they are treated. Who is targeted in a war crime is usually some members of an innocent/defenseless group or minority. If those people are being treated with excessive brutality to the point where it degrades their humanity, it is probably a war crime. This does not exclude enemy combatants from being victims of a war crime, but usually crimes against the general civilian population are more obvious crimes. 

In the case of Nazi Germany, many of their war crimes were not only obvious, but became the epitome of crimes against humanity. Naturally, the first and largest crime to come to mind is the Holocaust. The dehumanizing system of concentration camps and death units make for a chilling reminder of how far hate can go. Also, the Nazis would also commit many war crimes–from forced sterilization and euthanasia–on the homefront against Germans they deemed “undesirable” like homosexuals, the disabled, and gypsies. Finally, the Nazi hate machine reached beyond their borders and stretched to the frontlines of war, where they showed an utter disregard for civilian life through rapes, starvation sieges, and targeted bombing campaigns on non-military targets.
