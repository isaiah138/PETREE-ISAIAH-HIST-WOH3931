# Analysis 1
## by Brian Davis
When examining Germany during World War II, it becomes clear that the country committed a plethora of war crimes. This writing will discuss the mistreatment of Jewish people inside camps during the Holocaust. This essay will focus on forced labor, transit camps, and death camps, as these were the locations where most atrocities against Jewish people were committed.  From starvation, overworking, overcrowding, and poor sanitation these are the crimes committed by Germany during WW2. 

Description automatically generatedForced labor camps were places where Jewish and political prisoners were forced to work on Nazi war materials. Those Jewish people who refused to do so faced severe punishment. To focus specifically on Dachau, this camp is in Germany, the Nazis would use this camp to work and exploit Jewish and political prisoners. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos by Doris Bergen states, “In addition to Jews, there were numerous prominent politicians of various political persuasions. Then, after the Kristallnacht pogrom on November 9–10, 1938, more than 11,000 Jewish men from Germany and Austria were taken to Dachau. Most of them were released after a few weeks, on the condition that they leave Germany, and after their possessions had been seized.”[^A1] Moreover, staying at one of these labor camps could be just as bad as being sent to a death camp. For example, the article states “The SS doctors had no interest in healing the sick, who therefore avoided the infirmary for as long as possible. From 1941 on, moreover, they had to fear that they could be the subject of gruesome medical experiments there. In the spring of 1942, Luftwaffe physician Dr. Sigmund Rascher received permission from Heinrich Himmler to investigate, using prisoners, the stresses that Luftwaffe pilots were exposed to during plane crashes or parachute jumps.”[^A2] That said the Jewish and political prisoners were given a fate worse than death, being treated as human lab rats for Nazi science projects. Moreover, if the Jewish or political prisoners were not treated as lab rats they were worked to death. Wiesel states “The SS originally intended that the prisoners would cultivate the surrounding moors, but the plan only reached partial fruition. In some work detachments, such as the feared gravel pit, the prisoners above all the Jews were worked to death or shot while trying to escape.”[^A3]

Next, the Nazis used transit camps as temporary holding facilities during World War II, primarily for Jews, before transporting them to concentration and extermination camps. These camps were part of the Nazis' systematic plan to exterminate the Jewish population and other groups they deemed undesirable. As seen in the picture, transit camps were often located near major railway lines to facilitate the efficient movement of large numbers of people. The primary source image reveals the crimes committed in these camps. In the picture it’s clear that conditions in these camps were harsh and inhumane, packing people in like animals. This specific photo is of Jewish men, women, and children boarding a train in Westerbork. These families would be split up some going to work camps and some going to death camps. Moreover  As stated in Holocaust Survival Differentials in the Netherlands by Mamix Croes, “The evidence reveals that even though Jews from the highest social class were often able to delay transfer to Westerbork or Vught, they were no more likely to survive the Holocaust than those who went to the transit camps earlier.”[^A4]  With the picture and the quote combined it is easy to see that the Nazis subjected prisoners to overcrowding, inadequate food, and poor sanitation. They were often forced to wait for days or weeks before the Nazis transported them to their final destinations, where they encountered even more brutal conditions and, in many cases, death. All the crimes at the transit camps include separation of family, starvation, overcrowding, and beating.  

Lastly, death camp Auschwitz I, this camp was one of many other camps that shared the name. There was Auschwitz I, the main camp, Auschwitz II, a combination concentration and extermination camp, and Auschwitz III a labor camp. Focusing on crimes committed at Auschwitz I included mass murder, forced labor, medical experimentation, and inhumane living conditions. One of the most well-known and horrific crimes was the gas chamber killings. Nazis moved victims from the transit camps to Auschwitz, often without food or water. Upon arrival, many were immediately sent to gas chambers where they were killed however the few that did not get gas would work to death. As stated in The Wheels of Justice Turn Slowly by Rebecca Elizabeth Wittmann, evidence suggests that Jews, “were generally either immediately sent to the gas chambers or assigned to hard labor, a fate which few survived.”[^A5] What Wittmann is saying is that no matter what, if you were sent to this camp, you would face death. Another crime Witteman states is the “rabbit hunt, in which prisoners at the roll call were ordered to take their hats off, and those who reacted too slowly were beaten and murdered on the electrical fence.”[^A6] What Wittman describes nazi killing Jewish people for not being able to take their hats off simply is criminals. This action of unchecked authority only goes to show that what the Nazis were doing was just out of hatred for the Jewish community, all the crimes of the death camps were that of mass killing of innocent civilians during wartime forced labor, and starvation.  

When examining the history of the war crimes committed by Germany during World War II, it's hard not to think of the Holocaust. After all, the Holocaust was a mass killing of innocent Jewish people the world has ever seen. Even when looking at the primary source picture you can see the fear in the Jewish people's eyes as they were stripped from their families and loaded onto the train like an afterthought.  Learning and teaching this topic is important to history so that people know that it happened and so it can never happen again.

A crime against humanity is defined as “a deliberate act, typically as part of a systematic campaign, that causes human suffering or death on a large scale” or “Serious crimes committed against civilian populations as part of a widespread and systematic attack”.[^B1] The Statute of the International Criminal Court lists the serious crimes as: murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer, unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture, rape and other serious sexual violence, collective persecution, enforced disappearances, apartheid and other similar inhumane acts causing great suffering or serious injury. A war crime is “An action carried out during the conduct of a war that violates accepted international rules of war”, to this effect, crimes against humanity are themselves war crimes when committed in times of war, such as during World War 2.[^B2]

During the reign of the Nazis over the German state, many ethnic and social groups were brutally persecuted and subjected to crimes against humanity. The most well-known case of this is of course the Holocaust committed against the Jewish peoples. However, the sheer scale of the tragedy that is the Holocaust often leads to the other victims of Nazi crimes against humanity to be overlooked or even outright ignored. After the Jewish peoples, some of the other most numerous groups to fall victim during World War 2 were the Romani peoples, the LGBT, and the mentally and physically disabled or impaired. 

The Romani people of Germany, otherwise known by the derogatory name, gypsies, were labeled by the Nazis as racial inferiors and social outsiders, barred from the German people’s community, or volksgemeinschaft. As they were not recognized as true Germans, they were seen as parasites to be rid of. In 1935, the Nuremberg laws came into effect, laying the foundations for legal persecution against the Nazi’s targets. At first these laws only applied to Jews specifically, but in November of 1935, just a few months after they were first enacted, the Nuremberg Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor was amended to include the Romani people. Among the key effects of this were the revocation of Romani’s German citizenship, the banning of marriages or sexual relations between Romani and “true Germans”, the implementation of segregation, and the increased investigations and subsequent breaches of/complete disregard for privacy.[^B3] Anyone who was found to have tried and violated these laws, such as maintaining a relationship between a Romani and so-called true German, would be subject to fines and even up to a year of forced hard labor in a work camp. Amidst this, gypsies who managed to tolerate the new laws were also deported and executed en masse. These actions extended into everywhere that Germany expanded throughout the duration of World War 2, including German-occupied territories of the Soviet Union and Serbia. The Nazis did make some exceptions though, including people of “pure Gypsy blood,” those of Gypsy descent who were considered integrated into German society and therefore did not “behave like Gypsies”. Some of these so-called pure blood gypsies were serving soldiers and decorated veterans, or people otherwise engaged in necessary work for the war effort. Local authorities, however, often ignored these distinctions during roundups. Police authorities even seized and deported Roma soldiers serving in the German armed forces while they were home on leave. All of this culminates into what became known as “The Devouring”, the Romani Holocaust. Overall, it is estimated that at least 25% of the pre-war Roma population in Europe, that being more than 500,000 people, died as a result of Nazi rule.[^B4] 

Even those who were pure blooded Germans were not safe from the arbitrary persecutions of the Nazis. The LGBT, specifically homosexual men faced brutal treatment under Nazi rule. In 1935, Section 13 of the German criminal code, relating to “crimes and offences against morality”, was revised and amended, reshaping it into a strict and decisive weapon of law. Specifically, paragraph 175, which was a German statute that criminalized sexual relations between men; though it is notable that it did not criminalize sexual relations between women, in large part due to lesbian relationships being overlooked as less significant (though undoubtable the Nazis would have eventually targeted them as well in due time).[^B5] In addition, it was technically not illegal to identify as gay as long as one did not commit gay acts, though this technicality would often be disregarded. Under Nazi rule, all known gay bars and other such meeting places were banned and forced to close, along with any gay associations/groups, including sympathetic presses. Intrusive and invasive investigations were conducted on suspected closeted gay men and their associates, damning the careers and social lives and basic decency of anyone involved. It is estimated that there were more than 100,000 arrests for homosexuality during the Nazi reign, around 15,000 of those men were sent to concentration camps. Conditions within concentration camps were particularly harsh for homosexuals, for one, these men were often castrated without their consent or anesthesia. In addition, the social norms of the time combined with the barrage of Nazi propaganda led to even other prisoners in camps to look down on and mistreat homosexual men. Overall, gay men who were sent to these camps had a 60% mortality rate.[^B5]

Among the Nazis most notorious crimes are forced sterilization and euthanasia, the primary victims of these being the disabled. On July 14th of 1933, The Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases was passed into order, mandating the forced sterilization of certain individuals with physical and mental disabilities.[^B6] The disabilities most targeted were deafness, schizophrenia, epilepsy, blindness, and physical hereditary deformities. However, certain groups such as gypsies and black people were also victim to this law. By the end of the 1930s, more than 400,000 Germans were ordered to be sterilized. The Nazis were not satisfied eliminating the possibility of future Germans being born with these “abnormalities”, they too desired to eliminate their own generation’s “deficiencies”. In 1939, Hitler secretly authorized Aktion T4, which was a plan to exterminate all German individuals with severe mental and physical disabilities, these individuals were deemed “unworthy of life”.[^B7] German doctors and nurses in hospitals actively and knowingly reported their patients, effectively sentencing them to be sent to killing facilities. Said killing facilities were Brandenburg, on the Havel River near Berlin, Grafeneck, in southwestern Germany, Bernburg, in Saxony, Sonnenstein, also in Saxony, Hartheim, near Linz on the Danube in Austria, Hadamar, in Hessen; these 6 installations utilized gas chambers, and were specifically made by T4 operatives for this mission. Overall, there were more than 200,000 victims of Aktion T4, Nazi Germany’s euthanasia program.[^B7]

  In the end, the German crimes against humanity committed throughout World War 2 culminated in millions dead and countless survivors receiving traumas that would last the rest of their lives. While it can be easy to think solely of the Jewish Holocaust, the other victims, the Romani, the LGBT, the disabled, and all that they went through, must not be forgotten by history.

### The Hunger Plan and Starvation 

The German government during World War 2 committed many other war crimes that were not related to the Holocaust. One of the many war crimes committed by Nazi Germany was called the Hunger Plan.[^C1] In the words of Mark Mazower, “the regime was ready to spread famine amongst the people.”[^C2] The Hunger Plan would arise during Operation Barbarossa. Operation Barbarossa was the name for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Operation Barbarossa was an immense and daring plan. Mass mobilization of troops meant mass mobilization of supplies. One of the most important supplies for an army is food. Germany was already suffering from allied blockades before invading the Soviet Union, thus they planned to use occupied territory to solve their food shortage problems. The plan made by Backe and Himmler was to take food from Eastern Europe and leave none for any of the local populations. Herbert Backe, the man in the picture, would be the man truly in charge of this project. He was the Minister of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture.[^C3] He would be captured at the end of the war. He was planned to be put on trial at the Nuremberg Trials, but he would commit suicide in his cell and avoid punishment for his actions.

His plan was to use mass starvation as a way to mass murder the non German populations and secure food supply for the nazi war machine. The background of the plan was heinous, and to even plan to starve millions to death warrants a crime against humanity. Luckily, when it was implemented it was not as successful as Nazi leadership planned. The food supply fell short, and the plan never was able to fix the supply shortages of the nazis. Urban areas were hit hardest from the seizing of food. However, in the rural countryside it was noted by some officers that the locals ate better than the nazi soldiers at some points. Many Ukrainian farmers were able to hide food from the nazis in the rural parts of Ukraine.[^C4] 

The total amount of lost life is hard to calculate in the eastern part of Europe. Estimates range around the 4 million mark.[^C5] Russians, Ukrainians, and Belurussians were the main ethnicities that died from starvation in the east. An important note of this is that many of these deaths came in prisoner of war camps. Many Soviet troops were captured by the nazis and around 3 million died in captivity. The main reason being starvation.   

In fully occupied areas by Germany such as Poland and Greece many local populations starved. This was not part of the overall “Hunger Plan”, but it is of note that many locals died due to the nazis not providing the necessary amount  of food to those being occupied. In Greece, 300,000 people died during the Great Famine.[^C6] In Poland, Poles and Jewish Poles were given significantly less food compared to the German minority.  

### Relocation and Slavery 

During the Second World War Germany was facing more and more labor shortages as the war went on. To solve this issue the nazi regimes forced people from Eastern Europe to help Germany’s wartime economy.[^C7] The jobs these people did included agriculture, which ties into the hunger shortages as previously stated, and war industries. War industries would include munitions factories, clothing for soldiers, and other war based manufacturing. In total, 5.7 million people were forced from their homes and forced to work in Germany. Many of these people were from the Soviet Union, Poland, and even France. Recruitment for these labor forces resembled manhunts in Eastern Europe.[^C8] One quarter of the German workforce would be from forced labor. The labor these people were forced into along with the conditions they lived in is nothing short of slavery. This is different from the labor camps most people think of. These people were relocated to Germany versus being put into a camp in the east. Nevertheless, this type of forced labor resembles slavery due to lack of freedom and the manhunts in order to obtain workers.  

### Crimes against women 

During the invasion of the Soviet Union mass rape occurred. Rape and sexual violence has always been a part of war, but that does not mean these actions do are not crimes against humanity. According to Kelly Askin, an expert on international law, the nazi invasion of the soviet union saw mass violence towards women.[^C9] Nazi ideology saw slavic people as subhuman compared to the German race. This view made sexual violence towards slavic women more persistant since many soldiers would not even consider them to be human or less human than they were. In fact, soviet rape towards German women was cited by many soviet soldiers as revenge for the rape of their own women. This type of torture would scar women for the rest of their lives if they were left alive by the nazi soldiers. Many women were noted to be raped and then shot.[^C10] Thus, not only was the german army guilty of sexual violence but also the blatant murder of defenseless civilians. The invasion of the Soveit Union was not just an extermination campaign, but a campaign of sexual violence. Violence towards women tend to be overlooked in World War 2 due to the sheer amount of other war crimes, but their stories should be told and remembered, as well.
