# Analysis 1
## by Brian Davis
When examining Germany during World War II, it becomes clear that the country committed a plethora of war crimes. This writing will discuss the mistreatment of Jewish people inside camps during the Holocaust. This essay will focus on forced labor, transit camps, and death camps, as these were the locations where most atrocities against Jewish people were committed.  From starvation, overworking, overcrowding, and poor sanitation these are the crimes committed by Germany during WW2. 

Description automatically generatedForced labor camps were places where Jewish and political prisoners were forced to work on Nazi war materials. Those Jewish people who refused to do so faced severe punishment. To focus specifically on Dachau, this camp is in Germany, the Nazis would use this camp to work and exploit Jewish and political prisoners. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos by Doris Bergen states, “In addition to Jews, there were numerous prominent politicians of various political persuasions. Then, after the Kristallnacht pogrom on November 9–10, 1938, more than 11,000 Jewish men from Germany and Austria were taken to Dachau. Most of them were released after a few weeks, on the condition that they leave Germany, and after their possessions had been seized.” ^1 Moreover, staying at one of these labor camps could be just as bad as being sent to a death camp. For example, the article states “The SS doctors had no interest in healing the sick, who therefore avoided the infirmary for as long as possible. From 1941 on, moreover, they had to fear that they could be the subject of gruesome medical experiments there. In the spring of 1942, Luftwaffe physician Dr. Sigmund Rascher received permission from Heinrich Himmler to investigate, using prisoners, the stresses that Luftwaffe pilots were exposed to during plane crashes or parachute jumps.” ^2 That said the Jewish and political prisoners were given a fate worse than death, being treated as human lab rats for Nazi science projects. Moreover, if the Jewish or political prisoners were not treated as lab rats they were worked to death. Wiesel states “The SS originally intended that the prisoners would cultivate the surrounding moors, but the plan only reached partial fruition. In some work detachments, such as the feared gravel pit, the prisoners above all the Jews were worked to death or shot while trying to escape.” ^3
