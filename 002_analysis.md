# Analysis 1
## by Brian Davis
When examining Germany during World War II, it becomes clear that the country committed a plethora of war crimes. This writing will discuss the mistreatment of Jewish people inside camps during the Holocaust. This essay will focus on forced labor, transit camps, and death camps, as these were the locations where most atrocities against Jewish people were committed.  From starvation, overworking, overcrowding, and poor sanitation these are the crimes committed by Germany during WW2. 

Description automatically generatedForced labor camps were places where Jewish and political prisoners were forced to work on Nazi war materials. Those Jewish people who refused to do so faced severe punishment. To focus specifically on Dachau, this camp is in Germany, the Nazis would use this camp to work and exploit Jewish and political prisoners. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos by Doris Bergen states, “In addition to Jews, there were numerous prominent politicians of various political persuasions. Then, after the Kristallnacht pogrom on November 9–10, 1938, more than 11,000 Jewish men from Germany and Austria were taken to Dachau. Most of them were released after a few weeks, on the condition that they leave Germany, and after their possessions had been seized.”[^1] Moreover, staying at one of these labor camps could be just as bad as being sent to a death camp. For example, the article states “The SS doctors had no interest in healing the sick, who therefore avoided the infirmary for as long as possible. From 1941 on, moreover, they had to fear that they could be the subject of gruesome medical experiments there. In the spring of 1942, Luftwaffe physician Dr. Sigmund Rascher received permission from Heinrich Himmler to investigate, using prisoners, the stresses that Luftwaffe pilots were exposed to during plane crashes or parachute jumps.”[^2] That said the Jewish and political prisoners were given a fate worse than death, being treated as human lab rats for Nazi science projects. Moreover, if the Jewish or political prisoners were not treated as lab rats they were worked to death. Wiesel states “The SS originally intended that the prisoners would cultivate the surrounding moors, but the plan only reached partial fruition. In some work detachments, such as the feared gravel pit, the prisoners above all the Jews were worked to death or shot while trying to escape.”[^3]   



Next, the Nazis used transit camps as temporary holding facilities during World War II, primarily for Jews, before transporting them to concentration and extermination camps. These camps were part of the Nazis' systematic plan to exterminate the Jewish population and other groups they deemed undesirable. As seen in the picture, transit camps were often located near major railway lines to facilitate the efficient movement of large numbers of people. The primary source image reveals the crimes committed in these camps. In the picture it’s clear that conditions in these camps were harsh and inhumane, packing people in like animals. This specific photo is of Jewish men, women, and children boarding a train in Westerbork. These families would be split up some going to work camps and some going to death camps. Moreover  As stated in Holocaust Survival Differentials in the Netherlands by Mamix Croes, “The evidence reveals that even though Jews from the highest social class were often able to delay transfer to Westerbork or Vught, they were no more likely to survive the Holocaust than those who went to the transit camps earlier.”[^4]  With the picture and the quote combined it is easy to see that the Nazis subjected prisoners to overcrowding, inadequate food, and poor sanitation. They were often forced to wait for days or weeks before the Nazis transported them to their final destinations, where they encountered even more brutal conditions and, in many cases, death. All the crimes at the transit camps include separation of family, starvation, overcrowding, and beating.  

Lastly, death camp Auschwitz I, this camp was one of many other camps that shared the name. There was Auschwitz I, the main camp, Auschwitz II, a combination concentration and extermination camp, and Auschwitz III a labor camp. Focusing on crimes committed at Auschwitz I included mass murder, forced labor, medical experimentation, and inhumane living conditions. One of the most well-known and horrific crimes was the gas chamber killings. Nazis moved victims from the transit camps to Auschwitz, often without food or water. Upon arrival, many were immediately sent to gas chambers where they were killed however the few that did not get gas would work to death. As stated in The Wheels of Justice Turn Slowly by Rebecca Elizabeth Wittmann, evidence suggests that Jews, “were generally either immediately sent to the gas chambers or assigned to hard labor, a fate which few survived.”[^5] What Wittmann is saying is that no matter what, if you were sent to this camp, you would face death. Another crime Witteman states is the “rabbit hunt, in which prisoners at the roll call were ordered to take their hats off, and those who reacted too slowly were beaten and murdered on the electrical fence.”[^6] What Wittman describes nazi killing Jewish people for not being able to take their hats off simply is criminals. This action of unchecked authority only goes to show that what the Nazis were doing was just out of hatred for the Jewish community, all the crimes of the death camps were that of mass killing of innocent civilians during wartime forced labor, and starvation.  

When examining the history of the war crimes committed by Germany during World War II, it's hard not to think of the Holocaust. After all, the Holocaust was a mass killing of innocent Jewish people the world has ever seen. Even when looking at the primary source picture you can see the fear in the Jewish people's eyes as they were stripped from their families and loaded onto the train like an afterthought.  Learning and teaching this topic is important to history so that people know that it happened and so it can never happen again.
