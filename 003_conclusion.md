# Conclusion
## by Carson Banks

With all these examples, we can see how German war crimes played a role in the worlds view of the Germans before and after the war. Before the war ended the average person in most countries had no clue the true extent of the tragedy's that happened because of the Naziâ€™s. As we have went over throughout our analysis of major German war crimes destroyed the lives of millions of people leading to one of the highest death counts of any event in history. To wrap this all together the crimes that were committed by Germany during World War two were some of the most disturbing and brutal acts committed by humans to other humans. The Holocaust including death and labor camps, military occupation, civilian massacres, crimes against woman, crimes against the disabled, and starvation of millions of people to further benefit themselves truly show how their goal was complete racial domination for Germany. While it is upsetting to talk about and remember it is important to inform and remember those involved, not just to remember those who lost their lives and family, but to ensure nothing remotely similar is to ever happen again. After the war had concluded the world had to rebuild, millions of lives were lost, a lot of which were civilian lives. Effort was put into prosecute war criminals that survived the war. Trials, such as the Nuremberg trials, would show those affected by such atrocities that there would be definite actions taken amongst those involved in the crimes.  By remembering the victims and the horrors they endured we commit to fostering a global commitment to education and human rights so these acts of violence will cease to take place. Throughout this website we have talked about some of the many war crimes committed by Germany throughout World War Two, although horrendous it is important to tell these peoples stories to remember all they suffered.
